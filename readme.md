# Li's Awesome
Note: So far, no work has been worthy of admiration. This is not surprising, given that humanity has only just become conscious of itself in the midst of a multi-milleniae total war, putting to death/torturing every great thinker that rose from its ensnaring fascist-indoctrination (see Wilhelm Reich's 'murder of christ' and 'mass psychology of fascism').
